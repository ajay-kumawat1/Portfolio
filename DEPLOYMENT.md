- Add real social media links
- Update GitHub profile URLs

#### Project Information

- Replace demo URLs with actual project links
- Update GitHub repository URLs
- Add real project screenshots

## Performance Optimization

The portfolio is already optimized with:

- âœ… Vite bundler for fast builds
- âœ… Code splitting and lazy loading
- âœ… Optimized images and assets
- âœ… Minified CSS and JavaScript
- âœ… Modern web standards

### Additional Optimizations

- Compress images before uploading (use tools like TinyPNG)
- Enable gzip compression on your hosting platform
- Set up proper caching headers
- Consider using a CDN for static assets

## SEO Checklist

- âœ… Updated meta titles and descriptions
- âœ… Open Graph tags for social sharing
- âœ… Proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3)
- âœ… Alt text for images (add when you upload real images)
- âœ… Semantic HTML structure
- âœ… Fast loading times
- âœ… Mobile-responsive design

### Additional SEO Steps

1. Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
2. Add Google Analytics (optional)
3. Set up proper redirects if needed
4. Test with Lighthouse for performance audit

## Domain Setup

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Purchase domain from registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. Configure DNS settings:
   - For Vercel: Add CNAME record pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
   - For Netlify: Add CNAME record pointing to your Netlify subdomain
3. Update domain in deployment platform settings
4. Enable HTTPS (usually automatic)

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates

- Keep dependencies updated: `npm update`
- Update project information as you gain experience
- Add new projects to showcase
- Update resume regularly
- Check for broken links periodically

### Performance Monitoring

- Use Lighthouse to check performance scores
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Check mobile responsiveness regularly
- Test loading times from different locations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

1. **TailwindCSS not working**: Ensure `@tailwindcss/postcss` is installed
2. **Import errors**: Check file paths and extensions
3. **TypeScript errors**: Run `npm run lint` to identify issues

### Deployment Issues

1. **Build fails**: Check Node.js version compatibility
2. **Assets not loading**: Verify file paths are correct
3. **Routing issues**: Ensure SPA redirects are configured

## Security Considerations

- âœ… No sensitive information in code
- âœ… Contact form uses proper validation
- âœ… External links open in new tabs
- âœ… HTTPS enabled by default on modern platforms

## Analytics & Monitoring (Optional)

Consider adding:

- Google Analytics for visitor tracking
- Google Search Console for SEO monitoring
- Hotjar or similar for user behavior analysis
